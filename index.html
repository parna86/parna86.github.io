              <p>I am a third year undergraduate student at
                   the University of Edinburgh. I am currently 
                   pursing a BEng (Hons) degree in 
                   <a href="http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/utaisen.htm">Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering</a>.
                   <br> <br>
                   I grew up in the city of Dubai ("where everyone has taken a connecting flight
                   atleast once!"), but I am originally from Kerala.

              <h2>My interests</h2>
              <p>Front-end development is what I enjoy doing and I would like to pursue it as a full-time role. 
                I use <a href="https://codepen.io/ParnaHere" target="_blank">CodePen</a> to sharpen my skills. <br> <br> 
                 Outside tech, I play chess as a hobby. I also love watching TV shows like the <a class="michael">Office</a> and Modern Family! <br>
                 I am a part of <a href = "https://edinburgh-hoppers.github.io/website/team" target="_blank">the Edinburgh Hoppers</a> as well, and love the work I do as the Head of Tech and 
                 Website Coordinator.

              <h2>Projects</h2>
              <p>My favourite project by far is the <a src ="https://blocksrunning.web.app/" target="_blank">Block that Runs Away</a> game.
                It was my first real project that I had completed on my own, and now that I look back at it, taught me a lot 
                with respect to front-end development. 
                <br><br>
                Other projects I've worked on is the <a src="https://github.com/SDP-Group-1/oli" target="_blank">O.L.I.</a> medical assistance robot, an <a src = "https://github.com/parna86/ilp_cw2" target="_blank">autonomous drone</a> simulation and
                a website for my <a src="https://favourite-quotes-288820.web.app/" target="_blank">favourite TV show</a> quotes (in progress).
